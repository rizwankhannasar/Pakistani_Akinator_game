# Pakistani_Akinator_game
Description

This is a C++ console-based character guessing game inspired by Akinator.
It asks a series of yes/no questions to guess Pakistani Cricketers, National Heroes, Politicians, or Prime Ministers.
The project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory allocation.

Features

Guess Pakistani Cricketers, National Heroes, Politicians, and Prime Ministers

Intelligent yes/no question-based guessing

Recognizes famous cricketers (Imran Khan, Afridi, Babar Azam, Rizwan, etc.)

Identifies national heroes (Allama Iqbal, Quaid-e-Azam, Abdul Sattar Edhi, etc.)

Detects politicians and prime ministers

Demonstrates OOP principles in an interactive way

OOP Concepts Used

Abstract Class (Person)

Inheritance (Cricketer, Hero, Politician, Prime Minister classes)

Polymorphism (Person* person = new Cricketer();)

Function Overriding

Dynamic Memory Allocation and Cleanup

Technologies

Language: C++

Programming Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming

IDE/Compiler: Visual Studio / CodeBlocks / g++

How It Works

The player enters their name.

Chooses a category:

Cricketer

National Hero

Politician

Prime Minister

The program asks a set of yes/no questions.

Based on answers, the program tries to guess the character.

If the guess is wrong, the player can reject it, and the program can be extended to learn new characters.
