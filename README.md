# Pakistani_Akinator_game
A C++ console-based character guessing game inspired by Akinator. It asks a series of intelligent yes/no questions to guess Pakistani cricketers, national heroes, politicians, or prime ministers. The project demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic memory allocation
